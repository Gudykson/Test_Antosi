Początek
[LUKE]
The gods are real
Like the Greek gods
[ANNABETH]
Like the ones you learned about
But weren't paying attention to
[LUKE AND ANNABETH]
Well, they don't pay attention to you, either
[ALL]
Especially if you're their kid
[GROVER]
The gods have godly things to do
[GROVER AND SILENA]
Godly places they need to see
[CLARISSE]
Godly plans they need to make
That don't include
Me!
[ALL]
Yeah, the Gods are real
And they have kids
And those kids have
Issues
[BOYS]
Daddy doesn't love me
And mommy is a god

[GIRLS]
Mommy can't protect me
And daddy is a god
[ALL]
Mommy is too busy
And daddy is too busy
Busy, busy, busy, busy being a god
Yeah
You never listen to me
You never listen
You never listen to me
You never listen, oh
You never listen but
Now, you're gonna listen
Cause it's time you heard our side of the story
It's time you heard our story

[PERCY]
Look!
I didn't wanna be a half-blood
I didn't ask to be a hero seeking praise
Being a half-blood, it's scary
It mostly gets you killed in very nasty ways
I didn't want to cause trouble, trouble
I'm less a player and more the played
And, honestly, I'd be totally be fine
If I could make it to the next grade, next grade
Maybe you don't know what a half-blood is because your life is normal and happy and not constantly in danger, but my life...? Let me set the scene
We were on this freaky field trip
Freaky trip
That's when this story should probably start
[ALL]
We were geeking out on ancient Greek
At the New York Metropolitan Museum Of Art
[PERCY]
We stopped by all the statues
And learned about the gods
With Mr. Brunner and my substitute, Mrs. Dodds
Hadn't done nothing wrong
Wasn't rude
Hadn't rebelled
[ALL]
On the day it all went down
[PERCY]
The day I got expelled
Na scenie zostaje tylko Grover i Percy
[GROVER]
Baaaaaah!
[PERCY]
Dude, what was that?
[GROVER]
Uh, nothing!
[PERCY]
Why do you have peanut butter in your hair?
[GROVER]
Ask Nancy Bobofit. She's a monster! Well, not literally. I don't think..
She threw a peanut butter sandwich at you, I stopped it. With my head
[PERCY]
Grover, you're a good friend
[GROVER]
Aw...
Dude. I'm your only friend
Na scenę wchodzi mrs. Dodds
[MRS DODDS]
Mr. Jackson!
Please see me by the sphinx
I have heard much about you... Percy Jackson
Kicked out of five schools in six years. One might question your parentage
[PERCY]
Hey, don't talk about my mom
[MRS DODDS]
And your father? That's right... you don't know who he is! 
[PERCY]
What's this about anyway?
Uh, Mrs. Dodds?
You have something growing on your-
Mrs. Dodds zmienia się w erynię.
[MR BRUNNER]
What no, Percy!
[PERCY]
Mr. Brunner! What am I supposed to do with a pen- Sword! Woah!
MRS. DODDS screams, Percy and Mrs - fight
[PERCY]
Mr. Brunner?
Mrs... Dodds?


[Percy] 
Hello mom! How was your day? Mine was ok. We went on this field trip, I got expelled, I saw some nice, super x-rated art, museums are crazy!
[Sally]
The headmaster called me…
[Percy]
I’m not a bad kid on purpose!
[Sally]
Percy… I know! How would you like to take a trip, just the two of us?
[SALLY]
I can't tell you all my secrets
[PERCY]
Maybe you should start with one
[SALLY]
There's a place you need to go, where you belong. Where the things that make you different, are the things that make you special. Special like your father.
[PERCY]
Ok, so what is this place? Is it a summer school?
[SALLY]
More like a summer camp. It’s just over that hill, past that pine tree! I thought I’d be enough to protect you, but you deserve the truth!
[PERCY]
Mom, you are acting like I’m never going to see you again! If it is just a summer camp, then-
[SALLY]
It’s not any ordinary a summer camp! Percy, your father is-
Grover wbiega na scene.
[GROVER]
PERCY!
[PERCY]
What are you doing here? And what happened to your legs?!
[GROVER]
I’ve been searching everywhere for you guys!
[SALLY]
What is it? What’s wrong?
[GROVER] 
You didn’t tell her about the field trip?!
He met a fury!
[PERCY] 
Yeah, you’re a furry! What happened to your legs?!
[GROVER]
I’m a satyr! I’m half goat!
[PERCY] 
You couldn’t have mentioned this like a little sooner?
[SALLY]
Grover, is a fury after Percy right now?
[GROVER]
Uh, Fury, no no no no!
[GROVER]
It’s a Minotaur!
[SALLY]
Children!
[SALLY]
Grover, you need to get Percy to the border. When I say run... run.
[PERCY]
What about you?
[SALLY]
You're the one it's after, Percy. I love you so much. Ready? On three: one... two... run!
[GROVER]
You heard your mom!
[PERCY]
I'm not leaving her!
[SALLY]
Over here. Yeah, you. You want my son, you have to answer to me.

[PERCY]
Mom, no! Mom!
[GROVER]
Percy!
Don't pass out! Don't pass out! Don't pass out!

[PERCY]
Is this real? Am I dead or am I dreaming? Am I underneath the ocean. Or are my eyes just streaming?
This is weird. Oh look, a strange man in a Hawaiian shirt.
[POSEIDON]
"What belongs to the sea can always return to the sea." It's a seashell.
BLACKOUT
[ANNABETH]
You drool when you sleep
[PERCY]
What happened?!
[Annabeth]
Uh, you had an accident! But, you’re safe now! Your friend Grover carried you here, and I gave you ambrosia. It can heal almost any injury! Unless I give you too much, then it kills you.
[Percy]
Where’s Grover? I had this dream that she was a goat and there was this bull and my mom… where’s my mom?!
[Annabeth]
Um, I should tell Mr.D you’re awake! MR.D!

[MR. D]
Oh, you're alive
I suppose that's good news for you
But it means a lot more paperwork for me
So don't expect me to be happy to see you
Of course, being alive is temporary
So, maybe if I go away and play pinochle for a few hours, things might improve. For me. Not for you. You'd be dead.
[PERCY]
Where am I?
[MR. D] 
Great!
Someone find Professor Hay-For-Breath and tell him Peter Johnson is awake, so he better clip-clop over here!
[PERCY]
It's Percy Jackson
[MR. D]
Whatever!
One romp in the woods with Zeus' favorite wood nymph, and you're stuck running a summer camp for a bunch of needy half-bloods!
[PERCY]
Half-blood?
[MR. D]
Yeah, half-god, half-mortal. Does no one watch the orientation film?
[PERCY]
Did you say half-god?
[MR. D]
Yeah. And I half care!
I'm the god of wine
And I'm dying of thirst
[PERCY]
Wait, did you say you're a god?
[MR. D]
Dionysus, god of wine. The gods are real. Woohoo! 
Mr. Brunner wchodzi na scene.
[MR BRUNNER] 
Percy!
[PERCY]
Mr. Brunner? What are you doing here? This guy is saying all this crazy stuff about nymphs and gods and... what is going on?
[MR BRUNNER]
It's... complicated.
I did mean to tell you...
[MR. D]
But look, he's also a centaur
[PERCY] 
God!
[MR. D(Percy)] 
Another terrible day (Mr. Brunner!)
At Camp Half-Blood (You’re a horse?)
[CHIRON] 
You’ll get used to Mr.D! He can be a bit… well… he hates children!
[PERCY]
I thought you were a Latin teacher!
[CHIRON]
Hm, more like Ancient Greek. My true name is Chiron. And my real job is training Demigods, Half-Bloods, like you!
[PERCY]
Where is my mom?
[CHIRON]
Grover said she fought bravely, but a mortal woman against a minotaur...
[PERCY]
It wasn't a dream? She's really gone?
[CHIRON]
I'm so sorry, Percy
[PERCY] 
You say the gods are real? 
So if my dad's a god, I'd like to know which one. 
[CHIRON]
It could be... that is to say, the prophecies suggest...
But, that's impossible! See you at dinner, Percy!
[LUKE]
Tough first day? I'm Luke.
[PERCY]
All this time, I thought my dad was some dead-beat. Turns out-
[LUKE]
He's a dead-beat god! I get how you feel. Look, the gods are busy. They have a lot of kids, and they don't always care. If you're one of the lucky ones- They'll send a sign if they want to claim you
[PERCY]
And, if they don't?
[LUKE]
Then no one can blame you for holding a grudge. So hey, you're not alone. 
I'm going to be your counselor. The Hermes cabin takes anyone who hasn't been claimed. You know what that means? We're literally the reject cabin.
Welcome to the disfunctional family.
Well, rejects stick together! Oh, besides, there’s someone who’s been waiting to see you!
[GROVER]
I’m sorry! Satyr’s are supposed to be protectors! I’m the worst satyr in the world!
[Percy]
Grover! I am so glad that you are here!
[Grover]
Come on! I’ll show you the amphitheater, uh, the armory, the cafetorium!
[Luke]
*laughs* Poor kid! Wait, he really fought a Minotaur?
[Annabeth] 
Uh, more like barely survived a Minotaur!
[Luke] 
You don’t believe him?
[Annabeth]
He shows up out of nowhere, says he doesn’t know anything about us, buthe’s strong enough to fight a Minotaur! Something doesn’t add up! 5.CAMPFIRE
[Luke]
Come on! Grab some dinner and let the nectar flow!
[Percy]
Why is she scraping part of her plate into the fire? Is the food here really that bad?
[Luke]
Offering to the gods! It’s not enough that they’re omnipotent and all powerful! They like to feel appreciated! To the gods!
[All]
To the gods!
Oh, things couldn't be worse
When your folks run the universe
[LUKE]
My dad is Hermes
He messengers things
You'll know his sign by his shoes with those wings
I'd wait by the phone, but the phone never rings
Oh no
 
[LUKE] 
When your dad's a god, life can be tough
I met the guy once, and once was enough

Annabeth?
[ANNABETH]
My mom's Athena
She's smart and she's wise
She's sworn off gluten and she's sworn off guys
But if she came to camp, it'd be a surprise
Oh no
[LUKE AND KATIE]
Oh, no
Oh, and my stepmom, she hates me, and my dad works all day
So I left Virginia and I ran away
[PERCY]
Wait, is that true?
[KATIE]
My mom’s Demeter
Goddess of Grain
She gets excited when it starts to rain
But planting and planting and planting’s a pain
Oh no
[ENSEMBLE]
Oh no
[KATIE]
For his sixteenth birthday
My friend got a car
I got a fern in some dumb mossy jar
[LUKE]
Everybody!
[ALL]
Oh, things couldn't be worse
When your parents run the universe
Oh, things couldn't be worse
When your folks run the universe
[LUKE]
Alright, who's next?
Ooh, ooh! My turn!

I'm a child of Pan
God of the wild
For those who love nature, they're often beguiled
He's not really my dad, but I'm sort of his child...
Oh no...
[ENSEMBLE] Oh, no
[GROVER]
He went for a hike to explore new frontiers
And no one has seen him for thousands of years
[PERCY]
Chiron! Who's your dad?
[CHIRON]
Oh, well...
My father is Kronos
Remember my lecture
He ate his children
[LUKE]
Chiron wins

[SILENA] 
The goddess of love 
My mom's Aphrodite 
She tries to be cool but mainly she's flighty 
I'll bring home a boy, and she's there in her nightie 
[ENSEMBLE]
 Oh no! 
[SILENA]
It's so embarrassing, guys! 
I tried to seek help from even the fates 
Cause she steals my mascara and all of my dates
 [LUKE, spoken]
Alright Percy, it's your turn
[PERCY, spoken]
If I tried to sing, it'll probably cause an avalanche
[LUKE, spoken]
Oh, we're all friends here. Come on, give it a shot
[PERCY]
So my dad is some god
That's great I guess
Did he not want me? Or not want the stress?
Too bad he's the worst, and my life is a mess
Oh no
[ENSEMBLE] cheers
[Percy] 
I hope he shows even a trace
'Cause I got some choice words to throw in his face!
[ALL]
Oh, things couldn't be worse
When your parents run the universe
Oh, things couldn't be worse
[LUKE]
But I don't care where our parents may be
As long as you are here with me
[ALL]
We don't care where our parents may be
As long as you are here with me
[Luke]
Alright! Now, go ahead. Make your offering.
[Percy]
To my dad! Whoever he is!
[Luke]
Woah, woah, woah! Check it out! The stars!
[Percy]
Woah, what’s going on?
[Luke]
It’s only sometimes the gods send a sign…
[Percy]
Is that a fork?
[CHIRON]
It’s a trident! It seems your godly parent had claimed you after all! All hail Perseus Jackson, son of the sea god, Poseidon!
[Percy]
My dad is Poseidon? OH SWEET!!!! What? Luke! Luke, what is going on?
[Luke]
Oh, uh, Mr.D, he wants to kill you! I mean, talk to you
7.SCENA 
[Mr.D]
Zeus knows we got him! And he ain’t happy!
[Percy]
Wait, Zeus? Like, the king of the Gods Zeus? I don’t understand. Why is Zeus mad at me?
[Mr.D] 
YOU WERE BORN!!!!!!
[CHIRON]
MR.D!
[Mr.D]
NO! He needs to know! Haven’t you noticed there aren’t any other little sea godlings running around? No sons of Hades or daughter of Zeus! The big three gods aren’t supposed to have kids!
[Percy]
The big three?
[CHIRON] 
Yes, Kronos’ most powerful sons! Zeus, Hades, a-
[Percy]
And Poseidon?
[Mr.D]
And you know why? Because they’re always trouble! So, where’d you stash it?
[Percy]
Stash what?
[CHIRON]
Look at the boy, he’s clearly not a thief!
[Mr.D] 
But as long as Zeus thinks he’s stolen it, we’re all gonna suffer!
[Percy]
So what does he think I stole?
[CHIRON]
His lightning…
[Percy]
Oh, his lightning! I’m sorry! His lightning?
[Mr.D]
And not some crummy tinfoil zig zag from a Broadway musical! We’re talking two feet of celestial bronze, packed with God level explosives! Another God can’t touch it! A mortal would be incinerated! Oh, gee, I wonder who that leaves! A half-blood!
[Percy]
Ok, but I did not take anything!
[CHIRON]
We know that! It’s just that Zeus is the “Guilty until proven Innocent” type of God. And, your existence alone is suspicious…
[Percy]
So what happens to me now?
[CHIRON]
Well, there’s only one thing we can do.
[Mr.D]
WE SHOULD TURN HIM INTO Dolphin!
[CHIRON]
One reasonable thing. But it could be dangerous! You must go to the attic and speak to our mummy.
[Percy]
Now, when you say ‘mummy’, that’s like, old person for mom, right?
[CHIRON]
Be brave Percy! Because if you fail, all the gods will be at war!
[Percy]
Hello? Is anybody up here? Hello! Uh, I guess no one’s up here after all. 
[PERCY]
Is anyone up here? Hello? Just an echo. Guess no one's up here after- Whoa!
[ORACLE]
Approach, child. I am the spirit of Delphi, the speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo. Approach, and face your destiny.
You shall go west and face the treacherous lord
You shall find what was stolen and see it restored
You shall be betrayed by one who calls you friend
And you shall fail
To save what matters most
In the end
[CHIRON]
“Go west and face the treacherous lord.”
[Luke]
That’s got to mean Hades, right?
[Percy]
Why Hades?
[Grover]
The underworld is in Los Angeles!
[Percy]
Actually, I am not surprised.
[CHIRON]
Hades has always been jealous of his brothers. With each new war, his own kingdom expands. If he stole the bolt to incite a war between Zeus and Poseidon, we have to stop him. And, I’m afraid, by ‘we’, I mean you.
[Percy]
What?
[Annabeth]
A hero’s quest? It’s only the biggest honour a half-blood can get, so...
[Luke]
Annabeth is right. Your dad; he needs a hero to clear his name. This quest could be the whole reason he claimed you.
[Percy]
Because he needs me? Well, where was he when I got kicked out of school? Or when we couldn’t pay rent? Or when my mom just… No, forget it. I’m staying here.
[CHIRON]
Well, I’m afraid that’s not an option. 
[Percy]
What?
[CHIRON]
Mr. D was right; as long as you’re here, Zeus will punish the entire camp,which, means…
[Percy] 
You’re expelling me? Again?!
[Grover]
That’s not fair!
[CHIRON]
I wish there was another way. Once again, Percy, I’m truly sorry
[PERCY, spoken]
My mom's gone.
[LUKE, spoken]
From this world. But if she's anywhere, she's in the Underworld.
[PERCY, spoken]
I'll do it.
[LUKE, spoken]
You will?
[PERCY, spoken]
Yeah, I'll do it. So what if no one's come back from the
Underworld? I'll be the first.
[GROVER, spoken]
And I'll be the second first!
[PERCY, spoken]
Grover, I can't ask you to come
[GROVER, spoken] 
You're my best friend, dude, so don't get mad
But I suspect you'll need protecting when things get bad
(sung)
So if you haven't guessed
I'm coming on your killer quest
[PERCY]
So, bon voyage and fare me well
[GROVER]
We're gonna fight each foe, each curse, and spell
[PERCY]
We're gonna march straight down to the gates of hell
[LUKE, spoken]
Underworld
[PERCY, spoken]
Close enough
[Luke] 
Don't forget this: official Camp Half-Blood questing backpack. It comes pre-packed with everything you need: gold drachmas, ambrosia squares, dezodorant. 

[ANNABETH, spoken]
You need me too, Seaweed Brain. If you're going to save the world, I'm the best person to keep you from messing up
(sung)
I've got mad battle strategy
My mom will be impressed
I'm coming on your killer quest
[Percy, spoken] 
So, where is the Underworld?
[LUKE, spoken]
Look for D.O.A. Records
[PERCY, spoken]
It's a record company? Actually, I am not surprised
[CLARISSE, spoken]
Don't get eaten by monsters
[PERCY, spoken]
Monsters? Who said anything about monsters-?
[CHIRON]
Have a great quest!

[AKT 2]
1.WYBUCH AUTOBUSU
WYBUCH AUTOBUSU sound
[PERCY, spoken]
Guys, we just exploded a bus!
[ANNABETH, spoken]
Yes
[GROVER]
All our food was in there
All our money was in there
All our clothes were in there
All our food was in there!
 [PERCY, spoken] 
Do we have enough drachmas for an Uber?
[GROVER, spoken]
We don't even have enough drachmas for a cheeseburger!
[PERCY, spoken]
If you hadn't bought all those dam snacks–
[GROVER, spoken]
Uh, it was the Hoover Dam, and I was hungry!
PERCY, ANNABETH, GROVER – rozpoczynają kłótnię
[PERCY, spoken]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Why are we fighting?
[ARES, spoken]
I have that effect.
Ares, god of war. 
(They try to atack him) 
Wh-o-oa, whoa, relax, I come in peace! I hear you runts are headed to Hades, but you'll never make it on public transportation. I can take you as far as Vegas.
BLACKOUT
[ARES, spoken]
Vegas, baby! This is where I get off.
( he gives them a backpack)
[GROVER, spoken]
That guy is so cool.
[PERCY, spoken]
Oh look, a bus to Los Angeles!
[ANNABETH, spoken]
Are you sure that's a good idea?
[PERCY, spoken]
This one we just won't blow up!
BLACKOUT 
2. HADES
[Percy]
Guys, what if this is all a mistake? We’ve been so sure that Hades is the thief, but what if we’re wrong? The Oracle told me that I would fail.
[Annabeth]
We’re here
[Grover]
Are we sure we’re ready to do this?
[Percy]
Not at all. Let’s go… Well, this must be it; D.O.A Records.
[Grover]
I kind of figured there’d be monsters.
[Percy] 
Yeah. Who knew that the lobby to the Underworld would be so…
[Charon]
Dead? Going down!
[ANNABETH] 
That’s Charon! The ferryman to the Underworld. Uhm, we need to get to Hades.
[Charon]
Well, you don’t look dead. Read the sign. ‘No soliciting, no loitering, no living!’
[Percy] 
Oh, we are totally dead!
[Grover] 
Yeah! We, uh, drowned! In a bathtub!
[Annabeth]
All three of us!
[Charon]
Big bathtub… Passage across the River Styx isn’t free…
Dają drachmy
[Charon]
Enjoy eternity!
[Annabeth]
Come on. We need to find Hades. Stay close.
[Hades] 
You’re as bright as your father. Son of Poseidon. From the looks of it. He’s stupid.
[Percy]
Uh, you know why we’re here?
[Hades]
Hm. Yes, I know why you’re here. You thought I was the bad guy. Everyone always thinks Hades is the bad guy! Maybe it’s the decor, I don’t know…
Oh, I may not have stolen the bolt, but… since it’s here…What do the children say? Never leave a gift—God level explosive—in the mouth?
[PERCY] 
We don’t have the bolt! 
[ANNABETH] 
THE BACKPACK !
[Grover]
It’s the bolt!
[Percy]
Well, how did it get in my backpack?! No, guys, no, I didn’t steal it, I swear!
[Annabeth]
Well, then how did it get there?
[Percy]
I don’t know! How did you know where to find it?!
[Annabeth]
What? I didn’t! It was a hypothesis! ...A guess! Stop looking at me like that!
[Percy]
Someone is trying to pit the big three against each other.
[Annabeth]
No shit Sherlock
[Percy] 
You were framed! So was I. If you let us go-
[Hades]
And why would I want to do that?
[Percy]
Why would you want to start a war?
[Hades]
Because when the Gods go to war, it’s the mortals who suffer, and then end up here. And I do get lonely.
[Annabeth]
No chance! We came here to stop a war, not start one!
[Percy] 
Yeah, there is no way in hell that we- OH. 
That we are handing this over to you!
[Hades]
Even in exchange for her. Wyciąga Sally zza kurtyny
[Sally]
Percy!
[Percy]
Mom? Mom?! 
[Hades]
She is merely a shade! But I can restore her. What has your father ever done for you? He doesn’t care about his family! Or his brother! Who he never visits! Oh, no, he’s too busy playing with his mermaids and his dolphins! Acting like he’s so cool with his hawaiian shirt.
[Percy]
Did you say hawaiian shirt?
[Hades]
I could give you your freedom, your friends, and your mother. And all it would cost is a little war! The choice is yours, son of Poseidon. I’ll give you a moment to consider.
[PERCY]
Seems my good intentions
Always crash and burn
Everything I try to do will fail
Never once will I prevail
Going wrong at every turn
[SALLY]
What belongs to the sea
Can always return 
[PERCY]
"It's a seashell." No... it's a gift from a god.
I am the son of Poseidon
And I'm done running
Guys, I know how to get out of here!
I'll come back for you, mom. I promise.
Percy dmucha w muszlę i pojawia się portal

Whoa! It's a portal!
[ANNABETH, spoken]
What?
[HADES]
Oh, come on!
BLACKOUT
3.PLAŻA PRZY OBOZIE HEROSÓW
[PERCY] 
We were set up. And I think I know who did the setting
[ANNABETH]
But if it's not Hades?
[PERCY]
Who wins if the gods go to war? Ares, the god of war! I bet he's watching us right now.
Show yourself!
[ARES]
Ha!
Your mouth's talking trash
You better rinse it
Your meat is minced
I'm here to mince it
I'm gonna have my war
Now give me some space
I'm gonna wipe that stupid head off of your stupid face
[ANNABETH]
Percy, get to the ocean!
[ARES]
You think the god of war is afraid of a little water?
[PERCY]
How do you feel about a lot of it?
I'm The Son of Poseidon
I never asked to be
But I'm the son of Poseidon
Now face the tide  Inside me
woda, Ares znika, pojawia się Posejdon
[Poseidon]
The sea does not like to be restrained.
[Percy]
Dad? I mean… You’re Poseidon?
[Poseidon]
Oh, you can call me ‘dad,’ Perseus!
[Percy] 
You can call me Percy.
[Poseidon]
Alright.
[Percy]
Dad, I failed. The Oracle was right; I couldn’t save what matters most. I couldn’t save mom.
[Poseidon] 
You prevented a war between the Gods. And for that, well… The Gods may be unfair, but we’re not total jerks.
[Percy]
Do you mean that she’s…
[Poseidon]
On her way!
[Sally] Uwolniona Sally wchodzi na scenę
Percy!
[Percy] 
You’re alive!
[Sally] 
You saved me!
[Percy]
Well, I had some help.
[Grover and Annabeth]
Hey, Mrs. Jackson!
[Poseidon]
Uh… Hey.
[Sally]
Hi…
[Poseidon] 
You look… even more beautiful than the night we first met.
[Sally]
And you haven’t changed at all.
 [Percy]
Okay. This has to be the weirdest family reunion ever.
[Poseidon]
My brother’s going to want his bolt back. Should’ve been the God of drama, that guy. But, I’ll, uhm… see you around.
[Annabeth]
So now what?
Silena, Chiron, Katie, Clarisse wchodzą na scenę
[PERCY]
Where’s Luke?
[SILENA]
He disappeared yesterday
[CHIRON]
But Percy, he left something for you 
Chiron podaje list Percy’emu
[LUKE]
Chiron always says our parents made camp
As this safe magic space
The truth: it's so they don't have to see us
Ares thought we were starting a war between the gods, but it was bigger than that. It's about wiping them out - and taking our turn.
It doesn't pay to be a good kid,
P.S. The Oracle warned you. "Betrayed by a friend."
[PERCY] 
He was the lightning thief…
[GROVER]
He’s gone! But he won’t get far! All of the squirrels on the East Coast are searching for him!
[ANNABETH]
He’ll be back.
[CLARISSE]
And he’ll be sorry!
[CHIRON]
It won’t end, with Luke… These are dangerous times, for both Gods and mortals. I cant tell you what to do, but if you choose to stay, know that you have full protection of the Gods.
[PERCY]
No… Luke was right about one thing. It’s that we cannot just hide at camp waiting for our parents to fix things. We have to do it ourselves. Out there. In the real world. Cause that’s where the monsters are.
[ANNABETH]
The Gods… They think we’re impertinent.
[PERCY]
We are impertinent wise girl.
[CHIRON]
There'll be times when your faith is shaken
[SILENA]
They're breaking your heart? Then try to hear it pound
[CLARISSE AND ANNABETH]
Got to know where the real fight lies
[ANNABETH]
When it's time to rise
And stand your ground
[GROVER]
We don't have to DO it alone
[CLARISSE]
They'll put us in a box but we won't be contained
[ANNABETH]
You keep hoping
You keep your eyes open
[PERCY]
Cause the sea doesn't like to be restrained
[ALL]
No, we’re never gonna once have it easy
We will make mistakes, but our own, and it frees us
Summer's over, it's time to begin
[PERCY, ANNABETH & GROVER]
And if you're looking for trouble then count us in
[ALL SUNG]
Bring on the monsters
Bring on the monsters
Bring on the real world
Bring on the monsters
